Hi foaks!!<br/>
Aim of this file : implement ground filteration algorithm from a point cloud data of 3d lidar<br/>

The git I got for this implementes ground filteration and non-ground filteration simultaneiously. <br/>
https://github.com/lorenwel/linefit_ground_segmentation </br>
using this I was able to segment out my ground and non-ground points of lidar-pointcloud data
