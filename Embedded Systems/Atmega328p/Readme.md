This repository was created as part of a PCB design project for the Robotics Club at IIT BHU. But because of my interest in this field I will regularly update this repository even after the project if over.

All the codes in this repository were created in Microchip Studios 7.0 and are compatable with Atmel's ATMEGA328p chips only. </br>
